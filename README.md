# AI Art vs Real Art Image Classification

## A classification model for classifying AI Art and Real Art using CNN, submitted as part of the final project for the University of Santo Tomas College of Information and Computing Sciences' Machine Learning course

## Prerequisites

```Python
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
```

### For more information on how to configure Tensorflow and GPUs, please read this documentation

```None
